                <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
                <p><b>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam (Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam)</b> was born on 15 October 1931 in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. Coming from a humble background, he worked hard to pursue his education, eventually earning a degree in aerospace engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology (MIT). His passion for science and technology led him to work at ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation), where he played a key role in developing India's first satellite launch vehicle, SLV-III, which successfully placed the Rohini satellite in orbit in 1980. Later, at DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation), he was instrumental in developing India's Agni and Prithvi missiles, earning him the title "Missile Man of India." He also played a crucial role in India’s 1998 Pokhran-II nuclear tests, strengthening the country's defense capabilities.

                    In 2002, Kalam was elected as the 11th President of India, becoming widely known as the "People’s President" due to his simplicity, humility, and dedication to youth empowerment. During his tenure, he emphasized the importance of science, technology, and education, inspiring millions of students across India. Even after completing his presidency in 2007, he remained committed to his mission of educating and motivating young minds. He authored several books, including "Wings of Fire," "Ignited Minds," and "India 2020," which continue to inspire readers worldwide.
                    
                    On 27 July 2015, while delivering a lecture at IIM Shillong, he collapsed due to a cardiac arrest and passed away, leaving behind a legacy of knowledge, patriotism, and vision. His life journey—from a small town boy to one of India's most respected scientists and leaders—continues to inspire generations to dream big and work hard for the progress of the nation.</p>
